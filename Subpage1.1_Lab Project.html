    <p>DEK, a conserved, multifunctional human chromatin/ DNA binding protein, was originally discovered and classified as a proto-oncogene in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (1). Research of the past three decades has shown that DEK is indeed a bona-fide oncogene with observed overexpression in ~ 80 % of human cancers (2,3). However, the precise molecular details of its oncogenic activities remain unclear. 
        One defining biochemical activity of DEK is the ability to change the topology of DNA by introduction of positive supercoils in a non-energy dependent way (4). This activity may influence compaction of cellular chromatin and thus may be involved in regulating many fundamental DNA-dependent processes, ranging from DNA replication to transcriptional control (5-7). Thus, deregulation of this activity of DEK in cancer cells may contribute to tumorigenesis. 
        The ATP-independent supercoiling activity of DEK is mediated by two DNA binding domains termed pseudo-SAP (unique to DEK) and SAP-box located centrally in DEK (Fig. 1). The mechanism of this activity remains unknown. Based on experimental, predication and molecular docking data, we hypothesize that simultaneous intercalation of aromatic amino acid present in both domains is required for DEK's supercoiling activity. 
        To test this hypothesis, we utilized XX GST-fusion proteins, containing point mutations in one or more secondary structure elements of DEK (Fig. 2). These fusion proteins were expressed and purified from E. coli and subjected to DNA binding (EMSA) and 1D or 2D DNA topology assays (Fig. 3) .
